Dirty Block Cache(dbc)
---

SRC:
 fs/dirty_block.c

APIS:
 inode_add_dbc()
 inode_sync_dbc()

Related syscall:
 sys_fsync(fd)

How to use?
 When fs(minixfs) makes block dirty related some inode, it just calls:
   inode_add_dbc(inode, block)
 Finally, fs wants to flush all dirty blocks related some inode, it calls:
   inode_sync_dbc(inode)

 The dirty block must be related with some inode
   1. block which contains inode copy in disk (d_inode)
   2. data block of some inode (block == minix_d_inode->i_zone[?]) 

How to work?
 dbc only caches block pointers, which is different from block buffer.
  and every inode has a dbc pointer(NULL).
 First call of inode_add_dbc will alloc a dbc for inode.
 
Why?
 Without dirty block cache, it will traverse all blocks of some inode
 to detect whether the block is dirty, when user wants to sync some file.
